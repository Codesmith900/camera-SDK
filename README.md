# camera-SDK

A Camera SDK is like a universal remote for every camera, on every device. It acts as a smart "middleman," an abstraction layer, between your app and the complex, often finicky, camera hardware lurking inside every phone. 

A Camera SDK is a ready-made toolkit for camera features.
It's a clever abstraction layer, simplifying tough hardware and OS interactions.
It offers standard APIs and pre-built code, making development much faster.
